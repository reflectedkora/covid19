Covid-19 is also known as Corona Virus, SARS-CoV2. It is a virus that spreads and kills. Its lethality is owed in large part to being a new virus that the human body had no prior defenses for, and scientists had no knowledge to establish effective defenses.

Since initial cases in November 19 in Wuhan Province, China, we have learned much. 

1. The virus infects a person [five days](#incubation-period) before first symptoms appear, which make it difficult to prevent.

## pandemic  
It is important because the severity and speed of its impact has overwhelmed medical systems across the globe. When medical systems are overwhelmed, it's death rate increases further. As of April 2020, XX percent of the global population has contracted covid, XX percent have died. Governments have intervened to attempt to minimize it's toll. More than 4 billion of the world are urged to stay at home. Best predictions suggest the death toll will reach XX million before the global pandemic is contained.

## Transmission factors
People first worried Covid-19 can spread through air, but [not as much anymore](#not-spread-by-air).  
Air pollution increases it's transmission.

what is transmission likelihood to/from pets?

## incubation-period
incubation takes 5 days usually
- [5.1 days](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150748) (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days).

## not-spread-by-air
Measles is a virus known to transmit by air. The consequence is that measles is highly contagious, typically spreading to 12 people from each person that has it. Current data suggests Covid-19 spreads to only 2-3 people for each person that has it, suggesting it does not have equal capability to transmit by air, as Measles does.
