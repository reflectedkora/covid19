Air pollution increases it's transmission.

what is transmission likelihood to/from pets?

## not-spread-by-air
Measles is a virus known to transmit by air. The consequence is that measles is highly contagious, typically spreading to 12 people from each person that has it. Current data suggests Covid-19 spreads to only 2-3 people for each person that has it, suggesting it does not have equal capability to transmit by air, as Measles does.
