# purpose

This readme, and the target experiment **index** are to be simultaneously edited, along with supporting documents. Edits can be made to the rules proposed here in an effort to best refine the spirit of this objective: 

# To Maximize the efficacy of language for safety through learning.

## 1. to provide maximally informative content,  

  * relevant to broadest audience  
  * framed for broadest audience  
  
## 2. as efficiently as possible  

  * 400 words total  
## 3. pertaining Covid-19, potentially including but not limited to  

  * perscriptions of behavior to maximize safety.
  * predictions as based on past empirical evidence.
  * and supporting arguments essential for conveying these.  
  
## 4. an experiment testing  

  * the nature of collaboration on a document with heavy constraints imposed  
  * the potential to learn more deeply, given a document so constrained.
  
## topic: covid-19  
Covid-19 is an ongoing global emergency with a count of historically unprecedented features increasing regularly. Most of these pertain the singularity and universality of Covid-19's impact on human lives around the globe. Yet another unprecedented consequence of Covid-19 pertains mysteries of cognition, language, and learning.

1. Covid-19, as an object of study, represents the power and speed with which human insight can take shape and eventually shape outcomes. Already in months, scientists have cracked key mysteries (SARS-related) and rejected tempting solutions (herd immunity). However, this transformation is not complete. Critical components to the solution, including vaccine and immunity are missing.  

2. Scientific guidance based on the lethality of Covid-19 and urgency to quell it has imposed a dramatic, behavioral stop-gap that dramatically and broadly alters the lifestyle of many (4 billion and counting): People are asked to stay indoors, away from others and wait out the virus.  

3. Left powerless while the virus continues to kill, I hypothesize the effects of 1 and 2 promote the greatest *common*, intrinsic intellectual problem the world --at least modern world-- has seen. I argue that such commonality is a unique condition of shared, intrinsic motivation to learn. It is an opportunity then, to test the efficacy of language for teaching.
