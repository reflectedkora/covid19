# Epistemology of Pandemic Knowledge
_This project reflects an open-science, applied approach to building and sharing informed opinions._

## How this works
In this project is a single main document. The purpose of this main document is to give a baseline context of what matters most.
But how do we determine what matters most?

### First  
we take a rough stab at explaining the situation in the *main document* (see below).
As soon as we hit about 400 words, and need to make decisions, we move to the second phase.

## Second  
We begin discussions about the rationale for one vs another possible statement in the main document,
using supporting documents.

Through evaluation of the _Supporting Arguments and evidence_ in **Support Documents**,
and the context facts in the main document, we decide what is the working assumption.

## Third  
The third phase of editing is to balance the amount of space (words) in the main document to be proportionate to
- the most effective words for change, 
- on the points (kind of change) that matters most.


# Guidance for main document.
## 1. to provide maximally informative content,  

  * relevant to broadest audience  
  * framed for broadest audience  
  
## 2. as efficiently as possible  

  * 400 words total  
## 3. pertaining Covid-19, potentially including but not limited to  

  * perscriptions of behavior to maximize safety.
  * predictions as based on past empirical evidence.
  * and supporting arguments essential for conveying these.  
  
## 4. an experiment testing  

  * the nature of collaboration on a document with heavy constraints imposed  
  * the potential to learn more deeply, given a document so constrained.
  
# topic: covid-19  

Covid-19 is an ongoing global emergency with a count of historically unprecedented features increasing regularly. Most of these pertain the singularity and universality of Covid-19's impact on human lives around the globe. Yet another unprecedented consequence of Covid-19 pertains mysteries of cognition, language, and learning.

1. Covid-19, as an object of study, represents the power and speed with which human insight can take shape and eventually shape outcomes. Already in months, scientists have cracked key mysteries (SARS-related) and rejected tempting solutions (herd immunity). However, this transformation is not complete. Critical components to the solution, including vaccine and immunity are missing.  

2. Scientific guidance based on the lethality of Covid-19 and urgency to quell it has imposed a dramatic, behavioral stop-gap that dramatically and broadly alters the lifestyle of many (4 billion and counting): People are asked to stay indoors, away from others and wait out the virus.  

3. Left powerless while the virus continues to kill, I hypothesize the effects of 1 and 2 promote the greatest *common*, intrinsic intellectual problem the world --at least modern world-- has seen. I argue that such commonality is a unique condition of shared, intrinsic motivation to learn. It is an opportunity then, to test the efficacy of language for teaching.
